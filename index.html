        <h3>I have taken pretty much every class that has been offered at Bitwise and I have seriously enjoyed my time here. I have always wanted to do something in the tech field and these classes have given me the tools I need to go into the work force knowing everything I need to. Mobile friendly is something I have put off for a couple rounds of class but now I have an opportunity to do some work with websites and I need to further my knowledge in this area. I am looking forward to this class and learning everything I can from you. GEEKWISE IS AWESOME!! haha</h3>
